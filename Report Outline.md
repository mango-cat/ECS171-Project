TODO: sprinkle in some statistics
#### What is a Malicious Link?
* Definition: Malicious links, also known as "malicious URLs", "virus links," or "infected links," are distribution channels to propagate malware over the internet. Simply put, they are links that are created by cybercriminals with the intent of promoting scams, cyberattacks, and frauds.

### What is the Danger of Malicious Links?
* When clicked on, malicious links can download ransomware, viruses, trojans, or any other type of malware. 
* Malicious links can be disguised very well using social engineering techniques, making them difficult to spot. 
* An example of this is phishing, which often involves creating fake links that appear to be from legitimte organizations, but which actually have slightly misspelled URLs or redirect the user to a different site (Cite this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing but with one of their links). 
* The effect of malicious links goes beyond individuals - it can also compromise company networks if even just one employee clicks on a malicious link. Something something implications, data breaches, etc. (look this up and cite this)
* Malicious links can also steal login credentials for personal and organizational accounts and execute phishing attacks that steal personal information from victims (reword this a bit and cite this: https://www.sdtek.net/malicious-urls-and-how-to-fight-them)
* (FIXME:) Example: Bank of America phishing attack (look up: slightly misspelled URL, stealing money, etc.)

#### What can be done about Malicious Links?
* Security Awareness Training: train employees to recognize malicious links
* Email Security Systems: "dynamically scan URLs and determine whether they are safe to open" (Cite this: https://www.clearnetwork.com/malicious-urls/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20malicious%20URL,cause%20other%20forms%20of%20cybercrime.)

#### Issues with these Solutions
* Humans are fallible - malicious links can be disguised very well and people may not always be perfectly vigilant all the time.
* Spoofing (?) (look into this more)
* Elderly people - easy prey for scammers, may have an even harder time recognizing malicious links and phishing attacks
* which leads us into our proposed solution...
